# trivia-game-project
A trivia game project

The idea of the project this is to display my ability to use an API as pragmatically as possible and ultimately to learn the process of doing a project since I've never done a project before. Heavy Inspiration came from Anna Kubrow's code. I learned the how to apply the this keyword and the setAttribute and getAttribute method to put value's on the page from her, along with documentation such as mdn and W3Schools.

User-Story:
As a user I should be able to see a game interface of 12 cards each in a column with it's own genre relating to a geek topic aswell as the potential point you can get when clicking on the right answer based on the questions difficulty. When I click on the card I should be presented with a true and false button along with a question, I should then be able to click on the buttons and if the answer is correct the card will show green and then a score will be added to the bottom of the gaming interface, if it's false then a big red X will appear and no points will be alloted to the bottom total score. Then I will be capable of doing this process with the rest of the cards till no cards are left and the total score will be tallied to score how big of a nerd I really am.
