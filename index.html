<!-- /* 
    type ! to launch boiler plate code for html
    Create a link to CSS 
    Create a script to JavaSript using the defer method so I don't have to place the script at bottom of the page
    The h1 tag will hold the game title so the user knows the general idea of what question will be asked
    The div tag has a special id since it's the main interface that my trivia game will ultimately fit in
    I also attached a special id to the value of 0 because I will later add a function to it,
    to add of the amount of points the user gets when right answer is selected
